      <p>
        Hello world, I'm Thomas, a 13-year-old web developer in training. I'm passionate about learning how to build websites from scratch and turning ideas into real, working projects. Even at my age, I enjoy creating clean, functional, and visually appealing pages — and I'm excited to help others bring their ideas to life!

      <h2>My hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        Since I was 9, I've been passionate about game development, basketball, and skateboarding. Over the years, I’ve spent countless hours experimenting with games and learning how they work, which sparked my love for coding and problem-solving. Recently, I dove into web development and discovered how exciting it is to create websites from scratch. I realized that web development could be a great side hustle — a way to combine my creativity and technical skills while helping others bring their ideas to life. I'm always eager to learn new technologies, improve my skills, and take on projects that challenge me and let me grow as a developer.
